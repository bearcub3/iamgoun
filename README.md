Hello, I am Go-Un!    

I always had a desire to learn web development, especially, when it comes to the UI and UX.    
That's how I decided to have a career transition from a web design to web development.    
It is very fascinating to create a dynamic and interactive web sites/applications from static prototypes and the web technologies always intrigues me to keep learning.    

Since I have over 5 years of experience building static HTML and CSS websites, learning JavaScript was a game changer for me.    
As I do not have a traditional engineer background, I believe learning JavaScript from Udacity was a right choice and helped me to open my eyes to learning other programming paradigms and to solidifying the fundamental front-end development.    
I am confident building UI and responsive web with JavaScript and React.    
I currently am learning Redux and building RESTful API with Nodejs and MongoDB. Once I complete them, I am planning to move on to learning AWS(front-end path) and Graphql. As I already have a personal experience with deploying a simple static website built with Nodejs to Heroku, it would be another exciting experience. I do have a flair for design, a willingness to learn and am very enthusiastic about web development.    

As I am a novice in web development, my perspective will keep evolving and prone to change....
